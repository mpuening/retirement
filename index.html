It could be that...

I'm tired of running around looking
for answers to questions that I already know.

I might build me a castle of memories
just to have somewhere to go.

So... just spitballing here, but could there be <span id="days" style="color: red;">a lot of</span> days until retirement?
How many <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/workdays.html?y2=2026&m2=2&d2=2&ti=on">work days</a> is that?
